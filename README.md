# ZipTax

This is a Ruby wrapper for working with the [Zip-Tax API]('http://www.zip-tax.com/documentation'). 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zip_tax'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zip_tax

## Usage

### ZipTax.key

Before you do anything, make sure you set your Zip-Tax api key.

```ruby
ZipTax.key = "123456789" #sets the api key
```

### ZipTax.request

The request method takes an Hash as single argument, the keys in the hash can be any of the accepted keys from ziptax docs.

```ruby
ZipTax.request(:postalcode => 90210) #returns the raw request, jsonified.

     "rCode"   => 100,
     "results" => [
